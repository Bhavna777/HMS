# Hospital Management Rest API 

## Used Technologies - 
**Node & ExpressJS -**  Node.js and Express.js for their fast, asynchronous nature, enabling scalable handling of concurrent requests. Additionally, the vibrant npm ecosystem streamlines development

**MongoDB -** I chose MongoDB for its flexible JSON-like documents, scalability, and suitability for diverse data models.

**Mongoose -** Mongoose simplifies CRUD operations, providing a structured way to interact with MongoDB in Node.js.

**Cloudinary & express-fileupload** - I used Cloudinary to store images and express-fileupload middleware for handling file uploads in my Express.js application.
